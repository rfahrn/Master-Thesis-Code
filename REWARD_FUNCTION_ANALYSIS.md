## Citation for Thesis

If using this analysis in your thesis, consider this structure:

### Methods Section:
"We evaluated four reward functions (R3-R6) across 15 diverse test scenarios encompassing perfect matches, partial overlaps, error cases, and multi-box scenarios. Each reward function was assessed on mean reward, stability (standard deviation), and scenario-specific performance. The evaluation framework is available in the project repository."

### Results Section:
"R4 (Enhanced Smooth Gradients) achieved the best overall balance with mean reward 0.4896 (2nd highest) and demonstrated superior gradient smoothness while maintaining strict penalties for false negatives (reward=0.2653 for many missed detections). R5 (Soft Partial Credit) achieved the highest mean reward (0.4935) and excelled in complex multi-box scenarios (0.6688 vs 0.5650 for alternatives). R3 and R6 showed the best stability (std=0.3691)."

### Discussion:
"For GRPO-based VLM optimization in radiology grounding, we recommend R4 (Enhanced Smooth Gradients) as the primary choice due to its superior gradient smoothness, appropriate safety profile for clinical applications, and balanced performance across diverse scenarios. Alternative strategies include curriculum learning (R5‚ÜíR4‚ÜíR3) or prioritizing stability with R3/R6."
